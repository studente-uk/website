# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour until smooth. Cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly.
4. Gradually whisk in the milk and cream. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.
5. Remove from the heat and whisk in the garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Stir in the cheddar cheese until melted.
6. Stir the cooked macaroni into the cheese sauce until well combined.
7. Transfer the macaroni and cheese to a large baking dish. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top.
8. Bake until the top is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
