                Studente! is a free website/app that hosts easy to make, budget-friendly recipes 
                to help students develop their cooking skills through instructional videos and 
                simple recipes.

                Studente came from a realisation that there were no real student focused recipe websites,
                and we wanted to change that! We noticed that an alarming proportion of our peers were reliant
                on heavily processed food and take-away meals because they may not know how to cook for themselves,
                and we want to help students and other users to improve their cooking skills through our recipes,
                and perhaps discover a love for cooking and preparing meals that was locked away.
